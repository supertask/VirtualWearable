# Virtual Wearable

Here is one of my virtual wearable prototypes.
Until we have a very accurate BMI, we need a user interface in XR. However, existing AR/VR UI designs are often influenced by rectangular displays, which are not cool to me, so I made them in a sci-fi style and made them open source.

The next step is to create a generative AI agent that generates 3D scenes using the Unity engine and release it as an SDK as OSS. Now I want to learn about ML. Let me know if you have any ideas! 
Also, let me know what UI or OS you would like to see in the near future on the Issues tab or on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/supertask_jp).
