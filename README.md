# Virtual Wearable

Here is one of my prototypes of Virtual Wearable. Until we have very accurate BMI, we need user interface in XR. However, existing AR/VR's UI designs are often influenced by rectangular displays, which are not cool to me, so I made them in a sci-fi style and made them open source. Next step is creating generative AI agent that generates 3d scenes with Unity engine and publish as SDK as OSS. I wanna learn about ML now. Let me know any ideas!  

Let me know what UI or OS you guys want in the near future on the issue tab or to [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/supertask_jp).
